# 1. Introducing your data

Our data includes financial information on companies in the S&P 500 stock index from 1999-2021. This information was scraped from Yahoo Finance in November of 2021, and collected in a csv format for data analysis. The information includes metrics like sales, earnings, cogs, stock price, and market sector. The goal is to analyze and model this data to better improve projections for a company’s future metrics, like earnings. The variables in the data set are described below:



| Variable            | Meaning                                                                                                     |

# 2. Data summaries

Demonstrate that you have the data imported and ready to go in RStudio. Specifically, to each dataset,applyandincludetheoutputforthefollowingfunctions:dim(), names(), head(), summary(). You do not need to write anything.

```{r}
dim(data)
names(data)
head(data)
summary(data)
```

# 3. Data viz

In your final report, elements such as data visualization will be just as important as the models you build. Construct and discuss a series of 4 data visualizations that inform your research questions. Combined, these viz should:
• tell a story and follow a natural progression, starting with simple univariate plots and ending with multivariate plots;
• help the readers better understand the structure of your data; and
• inform the next step in your analysis: model building.

```{r}
#First Viz
tabyl(data$YEAR) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= `data$YEAR`, y = n)) +
  geom_line()+
  xlab("")+
  ylab("") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Companies Within the Period") + 
  theme_minimal()

#Second Viz 
sumUSA <- data %>% 
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarise(sumMarket_cap = sum(`MARKET.CAP`), 
            sumEarnings = sum(EARNINGS), 
            sumCOGS = sum(COGS), 
            sumSALES = sum(SALES), 
            sumCASH = sum(CASH), 
            sumInvestments = sum(INVESTMENTS), 
            sumReceivable = sum(RECEIVABLE), 
            sumInventory = sum(INVENTORY), 
            sumDebts = sum(DEBTS)) 

sumUSA %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = sumMarket_cap)) + geom_line() + theme_minimal() + labs(x = "Year") +
  ggtitle("Market Cap within Dataset")

#Third Viz
temp <- data %>% 
  group_by(COMPANY) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), 
            mean_MC = mean(MARKET.CAP)) %>% 
  filter(count == 23) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_MC)) %>% 
  head(50)
temp <- temp$COMPANY
data_2 <- data %>%  
  filter(COMPANY %in% temp) 
data_2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = EARNINGS, x= SALES, color = Sector))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.20)+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ x)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Sales and Earnings Relationship by Sector \n Among top 50 Companies by Market Cap")
```


# 4. Model building
Build and analyze 1–3 Bayesian models which will help inform your research questions. (Build- ing 1 model will be worth full credit, but you’re encouraged to go beyond 1 model if possible.) Keep in mind:
• Scaffolding is important! Model 1 should be the simplest model you can think of. You can build up from there, adding extra parameters/terms/layers as needed. THINK: is Y quantitative? Categorical? What’s a reasonable likelihood structure for our model? Are the data grouped?
• For each model, define notation, specify the model, provide a brief model interpretation (eg: what do the parameters mean).
• For each model, simulate the posterior in R and briefly summarize your conclusions.


# 5. Next steps

Identify your next steps. What improvements do you plan to make? Are there any ways you plan to enhance your presentation of this analysis (eg: shiny apps, animations, engaging graphics)?

We plan on continuing to focus on improving our hierarchical model in the coming phases. We hope to improve it so it better models the data and has better predictive accuracy. We are still thinking about how we will go about presenting our project and in what medium we will do it in. We are leaning towards more of a blog post type of work as this may be better suited for a broader audience that could be interested in our project.


# 6. Participation
• If your project group is working on a collaborative project, specify what eachg roupmember (including yourself) contributed to this checkpoint.
