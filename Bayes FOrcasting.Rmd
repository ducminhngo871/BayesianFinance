## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bayesforecast")
library(bayesforecast)
data <- read.csv("TOP_50_COMPANIES_update.csv")
```

```{r fig1,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1}Monthly live birth U.S.A",echo=FALSE}
dbirth = diff(birth)
g1 = autoplot(birth)+labs(y= "births (thousands)",title ="U.S. Monthly live births")
g2 = ggacf(birth)+labs(y ="births",title = "ACF")
g3 = ggpacf(birth)+labs(y ="births",title = "PACF")
g4 = ggacf(dbirth)+labs(y ="differenced births",title = "ACF")
g5 = ggpacf(dbirth)+labs(y ="differenced births",title = "PACF")
grid.arrange(g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,layout_matrix = lay1)
rm(g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,dbirth)
```

```{r}
APPL <- data %>% 
  filter(COMPANY == 'AAPL') %>% 
  select(EARNINGS) %>% 
  arrange(EARNINGS)
APPL
vector <- APPL$EARNINGS
class(vector)
class(myvector)
myts <- ts(vector, start=c(1999), end=c(2021), frequency=1)

sf1 = stan_sarima(ts = myts,order = c(1,1,1),seasonal = c(1,1,1),
                  prior_mu0 = student(mu = 0,sd = 1,df = 7))
```

All fitted models are *varstan* objects, these  are S3 classes with the *stanfit* results provided by the [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html) package, and other useful elements that make the modeling process easier. 

```{r}
sf1
```

After fitting our model we can make a visual diagnostic of our parameters, check residuals and fitted values using the plot method. The package provides the posterior sample of every residual, but checking all of them is an exhausting task. An alternative, is checking the process generated by the residuals posterior estimate.

```{r fig3}
check_residuals(sf1)
autoplot(forecast(object = sf1,h = 12))

```
```

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
