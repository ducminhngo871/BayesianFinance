```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bayesforecast")
library(bayesforecast)
data <- read.csv("TOP_50_COMPANIES_update.csv")
```

```{r}
APPL <- data %>% 
  filter(COMPANY == 'AMZN') %>% 
  select(EARNINGS) %>% 
  arrange(EARNINGS)

vector <- APPL$EARNINGS

myts <- ts(vector, start=c(1999), end=c(2021), frequency=1)

sf1 = stan_sarima(ts = myts,order = c(1,1,1),seasonal = c(1,1,1),
                  prior_mu0 = student(mu = 0,sd = 1,df = 7))
```

All fitted models are *varstan* objects, these  are S3 classes with the *stanfit* results provided by the [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html) package, and other useful elements that make the modeling process easier. 

```{r}
sf1
```



```{r fig3}
check_residuals(sf1)
autoplot(forecast(object = sf1,h = 12))
```
